      <description>I was responsible for building the Mentionmapp brand, redesigning the homepage, app and interface design and addressing the usability of the app. The design of the brand needed to feel approachable and friendly as well as analytical and smart. The app was previously built in Flash and is now updated to HTML5. Usability of the new app was crucial with a visual and complex tool, the use of colour was important to help guide the user.</description>

      <description>I began work with Spacelist as a part of a collaboration between GrowLab (a Vancouver based startup accelerator) and Emily Carr University to inject design thinking and process into startups at GrowLab. I worked with Spacelist to create a cohesive email strategy and campaign to foster a close relationship with our users. By the end of my semester at GrowLab. This successful project allowed me to come on as their UX designer to deliver high caliber work across their entire site.</description>

      <title>Cedric Bomford&#39;s - Deadhead</title>

      <description>My worked consisted of photo documentation, photo editing and film processing, archival and experimental research as well as assisting art direction and even art contsruction. Working for Bomford had opened my eyes to the art practice and was fascinating to be apart of a creative process that was rather more humanistic and fluid then design. When I was brought into the project, Deadhead had already been under construction for a year and the centerpiece, affectionately named the beercan, had been mostly constructed.</description>

      <title>Designing Addiction: Our moral obligation to users</title>

      <description>I find this to be a very interesting topic, being a user experience designer. But, I feel stuck between two sides here. One could argue that users need to take control of their digital habits and prevent passive obedience to their phones. Another could say that it is the fault of software companies and startups striving to retain that beautiful metric of “engagement”. Recently, I had a meeting with my design team discussing focus and goal setting.</description>

      <title>Solidwood Lamp</title>

      <description>The objective of this project was to design a home object based on an essay from Sherry Turkle’s book, Evocative Objects. This process began with the short essay The Axe Head by David Mitten. Inspired by the description of an axe chopping into wood, The Solidwood Lamp was designed to transition from its natural form at the base to a man-made aesthetic with the bulb. This play between the organic and the manmade forms expresses the relationship between the origins of the material from which the lamp is made and its function.</description>

      <title>Prototyping with markdown</title>

      <description>I have been working on a large set of documentation for a prototype that will eventually make it into a product. One issue with the publishing system at my company is that it makes doing prototypes, or really anything not within the rigidly and narrowly scoped model, difficult to set up. It takes a lot of work just to get to the point where you can begin writing.
Since time was of the essence and writing is expensive, I decided to do the prototype outside of the publishing system.</description>

      <title>What to do with a single sheet of plywood</title>

      <description>The challenge of this project was to design a table from a single sheet of 60x60 ¾ inch birch plywood with minimal waste.kept the form of the table very simple with clean lines and aesthetically modern. One of the greatest features is the laminated legs, which allows the table to have a unique form and remain very stable. From cutlist to assembly the table took, in all, five hours to build.</description>
